# Common Issues and Solutions

## Connection Problems

**Q: Why can't I connect to the service?**

A: Connection issues can be caused by several factors:
1. Check your internet connection
2. Verify that your API key is valid and not expired
3. Ensure you're using the correct endpoint URL
4. Check if there are any service outages on our status page

## Scan Results

**Q: Why is my scan taking so long?**

A: Scan duration depends on several factors:
1. The size and complexity of the target
2. The type of scan selected (quick scans are faster than comprehensive ones)
3. Current system load
4. Network conditions

For large targets, comprehensive scans can take up to several hours.

**Q: How do I interpret the risk levels in my scan results?**

A: Our risk levels are defined as follows:
- **Critical**: Requires immediate attention. These vulnerabilities can be easily exploited and may lead to system compromise.
- **High**: Should be addressed as soon as possible. These vulnerabilities pose a significant risk.
- **Medium**: Should be planned for remediation. These vulnerabilities pose a moderate risk.
- **Low**: Should be addressed when possible. These vulnerabilities pose a minimal risk.
- **Informational**: No immediate action required. These are not vulnerabilities but information that might be useful.
